# Orbhold

A browser-based arena game built with vanilla JavaScript. Grow your army by collecting slimes, clash with rival players, and be the last one standing — or the biggest when time runs out.

## How to Play

- Collect slimes to grow your character circle
- Collide with other players to fight and knock out characters
- Win by having the most characters when the timer ends, or by being the last player alive
